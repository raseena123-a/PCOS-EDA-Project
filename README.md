# PCOS-EDA-Project
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a clinical dataset related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It investigates potential patterns in hormonal levels, physical symptoms, lifestyle habits, and menstrual irregularity among women with and without PCOS.
## Objectives

- Understand differences in hormone levels (LH, FSH, AMH) between PCOS and non-PCOS groups.
- Analyze physical symptoms (weight gain, pimples, hair loss, etc.).
- Examine lifestyle factors such as fast food consumption and regular exercise.
- Identify which features most correlate with PCOS.
- Visualize cycle irregularity and follicle count differences.

##  Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- google colab

- ##  Key Insights

This EDA explores how clinical and lifestyle variables differ between women with and without PCOS.

1. **Class Distribution**
   - The dataset has more women without PCOS than with PCOS, showing a clear class imbalance.

2. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
   - Women with PCOS tend to have a higher BMI, indicating a possible link between obesity and PCOS.

3. **Hormonal Differences**
   - PCOS patients show significantly elevated levels of:
     - **LH (Luteinizing Hormone)**
     - **AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone)**
   - The **LH/FSH ratio** is commonly greater than 2 in PCOS patients, which is a known diagnostic marker.

4. **Physical Symptoms**
   - PCOS patients more frequently report:
     - Weight gain
     - Pimples
     - Hair loss
     - Skin darkening
     - Excessive hair growth

5. **Menstrual Irregularity**
   - A large portion of PCOS patients have irregular cycles, while non-PCOS patients mostly report regular cycles.

6. **Follicle Count**
   - Women with PCOS tend to have significantly more ovarian follicles, consistent with the "polycystic" aspect of the syndrome.

7. **Lifestyle Factors**
   - PCOS patients are more likely to:
     - Consume fast food frequently
     - Exercise less regularly
   - These factors may contribute to or worsen PCOS symptoms.
   - ##  Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis on the PCOS dataset highlights clear distinctions between women with and without Polycystic Ovary Syndrome across various clinical, physical, and lifestyle features.Key findings indicate that PCOS is associated with hormonal imbalances (notably higher LH and AMH levels), increased BMI, irregular menstrual cycles, and physical symptoms such as acne, hair loss, and skin darkening. Additionally, lifestyle patterns—such as frequent fast food consumption and lack of regular exercise—appear to be more common among PCOS patients.
By visualizing and analyzing these patterns, this project provides valuable insights that align with known clinical understanding of PCOS. These insights can support early detection efforts and underscore the importance of lifestyle management in mitigating PCOS-related symptoms.
This analysis also lays the foundation for potential machine learning models to predict PCOS in clinical settings.
