# PCOS-EDA-Project
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a clinical dataset related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It investigates potential patterns in hormonal levels, physical symptoms, lifestyle habits, and menstrual irregularity among women with and without PCOS.
## Objectives

- Understand differences in hormone levels (LH, FSH, AMH) between PCOS and non-PCOS groups.
- Analyze physical symptoms (weight gain, pimples, hair loss, etc.).
- Examine lifestyle factors such as fast food consumption and regular exercise.
- Identify which features most correlate with PCOS.
- Visualize cycle irregularity and follicle count differences.
- 
##  Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- google colab
- # dataset

- ##  Key Insights

This EDA explores how clinical and lifestyle variables differ between women with and without PCOS.

1. **Class Distribution**
   - The dataset has more women without PCOS than with PCOS, showing a clear class imbalance.

2. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
   - Women with PCOS tend to have a higher BMI, indicating a possible link between obesity and PCOS.

3. **Hormonal Differences**
   - PCOS patients show significantly elevated levels of:
     - **LH (Luteinizing Hormone)**
     - **AMH (Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone)**
   - The **LH/FSH ratio** is commonly greater than 2 in PCOS patients, which is a known diagnostic marker.

4. **Physical Symptoms**
   - PCOS patients more frequently report:
     - Weight gain
     - Pimples
     - Hair loss
     - Skin darkening
     - Excessive hair growth

5. **Menstrual Irregularity**
   - A large portion of PCOS patients have irregular cycles, while non-PCOS patients mostly report regular cycles.

6. **Follicle Count**
   - Women with PCOS tend to have significantly more ovarian follicles, consistent with the "polycystic" aspect of the syndrome.

7. **Lifestyle Factors**
   - PCOS patients are more likely to:
     - Consume fast food frequently
     - Exercise less regularly
   - These factors may contribute to or worsen PCOS symptoms.
